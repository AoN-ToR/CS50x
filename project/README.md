# BJJ Repertory App
#### Video Demo:  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdiADW28iig>
#### Description:
The goal of this mini web-application was to allow the user to keep a repertory of each position and technique in brasilian
jiu-jitsu that he learned. As such, i decided to add multiple features.

I created databases, as well as user-friendly ways to acces and modify them at will. From the "Modify" page, they can access
and modify their own repertory of positions and techniques, thanks to the 2 databases and a unique user_id. In order to keep it
understandable for each user, i thought of overcoming the language barrier / different names of each technique and or positions
by allowing users to name them as they'd like. Moreover, to be able to have a better feel with the interface, i added a
difficulty rating (updatable as well) and a favorite status, that way each element will be more recognisable and it would be
easier to realise what it would be like in a real match. It also helps with the process of making a gameplan.

On the other side, this web-app allows user to recall what they learned in a somewhat dynamic fashion, that being the main
point of those minigames. They can keep track of thier best performance and as such motivates themselves to keep getting better
at knowing which reaction to chose from to go from a base position to their goal position.

At last, i decided to implemant a way to "share the website", even though it is not truly released online. Using a database
to stock each account crypted login informations allows for more privacy, as well as allowing to personalise techniques and positions names.

In total, i made 4 databases : Techniques, Positions, Users, Streaks. I wanted this to be not only a cool thing in my eyes as well as one
which would satisfy the CS50x requirement, but something that could help me build myself up from my failure and acheive my goals.

I started Brasilian Jiu-Jitsu about a year ago. My intents in this sport were numerous : Having fun, get to use all that leftover energy from
a long day, stop cutting myself some slack and actually feel like i'm actively trying despite being in a difficult position... Learning not to give up.
In first grade of highschool, i got assaulted on my way to get to the museum with my harpsichord class (i've played music since i was four).
I've never truly recovered from that. A year later, it got so bad i couldn't sleep for days at a time, fainting everytime i tried to do something.
I felt as weak as ever. Moreover, i was trapped in my mind, my doubts, and my fears. Panic attack, every week, sometimes everyday. It affected my life
greatly, my overall health was heavely declining, and all i could feel was the memory of that same punch, over and over, on the back of my neck.
It was as if it was hitting for real, terrifying. However... beginning Bjj allowed me to take back at least some form of control on my life, anxiety,
and overall confidance and mental health. I can even sleep again ! I realised all i wanted that day, was a helping hand. So i did what i felt would suit
my situation best, and decided to try and become the one who could've try and save me that day. Perhaps i'll get assaulted again one day, or some other
people. But at least this time, i won't give up on my self like i once did, or on the person under attack. I may not be able to defend them, but at least
i'll know i try. Each day i go to the Bjj gym, i know i still try, to buy back my trust, to defend the little kid inside, i try... to try.
As such, this project comes as a way for me to show my gratitude towards this sport.

I would also like to give a huge thank you to all of you cs50 professors, as i want to go into one of the many fields of computer science (i do not
know yet each one, stay tune to find out i guess ;]) and i feel your teaching expends far beyond this cs50x class and will help me get thourgh this
adventure as a more prepared student. I hope you like what i made.


Thank you all !
